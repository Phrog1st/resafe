## What is Spectral Radius?

The **spectral radius** is the largest eigenvalue (λ) of the regex automaton's adjacency matrix. It mathematically represents the growth rate of possible execution paths.

<Callout type="info">
  **Simple rule**: If spectral radius > 1.0, the regex has exponential backtracking vulnerability.
</Callout>

## How It Works

When Resafe analyzes a regex:

1. Converts regex to finite automaton (NFA)
2. Builds adjacency matrix of state transitions
3. Computes largest eigenvalue using power iteration
4. Compares eigenvalue to threshold

### Mathematical Meaning

```
λ ≤ 1.0  →  Linear/polynomial time (SAFE)
λ > 1.0  →  Exponential time (UNSAFE)
```

The higher the radius, the worse the exponential growth:

| Radius | Growth Rate | Risk Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0.5 - 1.0 | Linear | ✅ Safe |
| 1.0 - 2.0 | Moderate exponential | ⚠️ Warning |
| 2.0 - 4.0 | High exponential | ❌ Dangerous |
| > 4.0 | Severe exponential | 🔴 Critical |
