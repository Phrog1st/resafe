## What is ReDoS?

Regular Expression Denial of Service occurs when a regex engine gets stuck in catastrophic backtracking, potentially freezing your application's event loop. A single malicious input can bring down your entire service.

```ts
// This innocent-looking regex can freeze your app
const dangerous = /(a+)+$/;
dangerous.test("aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaX"); // Takes exponential time!
```

## How Resafe Helps

Resafe analyzes regex patterns **before execution** using mathematical spectral analysis:

- **Prevention First**: Block unsafe patterns before they reach production
- **Spectral Analysis**: Thompson NFA construction with eigenvalue computation
- **Fast Analysis**: Average analysis time \<1ms per typical pattern
- **Deterministic**: Analyzes automaton structure, not heuristic patterns
